```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

The original code `function sum() {return a + b}` has a few potential issues:

1. **Missing Parameters:** The function is defined without any input parameters. While JavaScript allows this, it means
the function is expecting `a` and `b` to be defined in the surrounding scope (e.g., global variables). This makes the
function less self-contained and harder to reason about.

2. **Undefined `a` and `b` (likely):** If `a` and `b` are not defined in the surrounding scope, the function will try to
access undefined variables, resulting in `NaN` (Not a Number) being returned.

**The corrected code:**

* **`function sum(a, b) { ... }`:** This defines a function named `sum` that takes two parameters: `a` and `b`. These
are local variables within the function's scope.

* **`return a + b;`:** This line calculates the sum of `a` and `b` and returns the result.

**How to Use It:**

```javascript
let result = sum(5, 3); // Call the function with arguments 5 and 3
console.log(result); // Output: 8

let result2 = sum(10, -2); // Call the function with arguments 10 and -2
console.log(result2); // Output: 8
```

**Best Practices:**

* **Always define parameters:** Explicitly defining parameters makes your functions more predictable and easier to
understand. It avoids relying on variables in the outer scope.
* **Type checking (optional):** In JavaScript (which is dynamically typed), you might consider adding checks to ensure
that `a` and `b` are numbers if you expect them to be. For example:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return "Error: Both inputs must be numbers"; // Or throw an error
}
return a + b;
}
```

This adds a simple type check to make the function more robust. However, remember that JavaScript doesn't enforce types
at compile time. TypeScript would be a better choice if you need strong typing.
